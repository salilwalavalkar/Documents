Methods - What to return [Null v/s Empty List]

Collections.emptyList() [Immutable]
The main difference is that Collections.emptyList() returns an immutable list, i.e., a list to which you cannot add or remove elements.
In the rare cases in which you do want to modify the returned list, this would thus not be an option. I'd say that 
returning an immutable list is perfectly fine (and even the preferred way) as long as the contract (documentation) 
does not explicitly state differently.
